MD5 Hash: 17444c8c52e9a0f0bc4629cadf0ca99b (determined using the md5sum command)

SHA256 Hash: 5e66d51d5130e19b1e8c398947b277b201a9af9c5182ed7bc3e83610977e9437

Executable Format: Portable Executable (PE)

Submission Time: Mon Oct 07 14:16:18 EDT 2024


-VirusTotal Scan-

The executable was submitted to VirusTotal. Results:

MD5: 17444c8c52e9a0f0bc4629cadf0ca99b 

SHA-1: 3e0fc831b0d50b93ab5f81721e1a311b8103d37f

SHA-256: 5e66d51d5130e19b1e8c398947b277b201a9af9c5182ed7bc3e83610977e9437

Vhash: 23503665151310815b47d9084e

Authentihash: 4d770b866d5280993367e8280677623f815f5bdc8f29f0812d19de90ba00e02e

File type: Win32 EXE (executable, windows, win32, pe, peexe)

File size: 300.50 KB (307712 bytes)

PEiD packer: .NET executable 


-PE Structure Analysis (Using PEView)- 

DOS Header: The message "This program cannot be run in DOS mode" confirms that the file is designed to run in Windows environments.

IMAGE_NT_HEADERS: Identified key sections:

.text: Contains the executable code.
.rdata: Read-only data, such as constants and imported function names.
.data: Writable data section.
.rsrc: Resource section.
.reloc: Relocation information

-Entropy Analysis (Using Binwalk)-
Entropy spikes indicate compressed or encrypted data sections:
0x27000: Rising entropy edge (0.972102) suggests high entropy, potentially an encrypted or compressed section.
0x73000 and 0x77C00: Falling entropy edges (0.839077 and 0.604273) may indicate unpacking or decoding processes.

-Reverse Engineering (Using Ghidra)-
Functions Analysis:
Main Function: Investigated the main function and other key functions for suspicious behavior. No direct obfuscation detected, but identified typical setup code.
Import Table: Examined imported libraries and functions. 

***Dynamic Analysis***

I used ANY.RUN as a sandbox for dynamic analysis (I used different malware file from static analysis)

File name: b39525df56e9d5f26067add74133154b651ca91d4201302ce505444d00ac6693.exe
Full analysis: https://app.any.run/tasks/75b8a1e7-f613-492c-b2cd-67dcec8ad86c
Verdict: Malicious activity
Threats: CryptBot
CryptBot is an advanced Windows-targeting infostealer delivered via pirate sites with "cracked" software. It has been �rst observed in the wild in 2019.
GCleaner
GCleaner is a type of malware loader that has the capability to deliver numerous malicious software programs, which differ based on the location of the targeted victim. This malware is
commonly spread through fraudulent websites that advertise free PC optimization tools
Loader
A loader is malicious software that in�ltrates devices to deliver malicious payloads. This malware is capable of infecting victims’ computers, analyzing their system information, and installing
other types of threats, such as trojans or stealers. Criminals usually deliver loaders through phishing emails and links by relying on social engineering to trick users into downloading and
running their executables. Loaders employ advanced evasion and persistence tactics to avoid detection.
PrivateLoader
PrivateLoader is a malware family that is speci�cally created to infect computer systems and drop additional malicious programs. It operates using a pay-per-install business model, which
means that the individuals behind it are paid for each instance of successful deployment of different types of harmful programs, including trojans, stealers, and other ransomware.
Stealer
Stealers are a group of malicious software that are intended for gaining unauthorized access to users’ information and transferring it to the attacker. The stealer malware category includes
various types of programs that focus on their particular kind of data, including �les, passwords, and cryptocurrency. Stealers are capable of spying on their targets by recording their keystrokes
and taking screenshots. This type of malware is primarily distributed as part of phishing campaigns.
